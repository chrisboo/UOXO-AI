# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Agent
An AI agent that plays the Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB).

# Game Play

```
python main.py 2000
```

where `2000` is the number of tree search iteration. A larger value increases the strength of the AI, as well as the time needed for it to make a decision. Suggested values are multiples of `1000`.

# Board Indexing

Each cell is numbered from 0 to 80 (81 cells in total).

```
 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...

 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...

 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...
```

The numbering for the top-left local board is

```
 012
 345
 678
```

Then the next 9 numbers (9-17) belongs to the top-middle local board, with order similar to the one shown above.

Some examples:

```
 Cell 20
 ... ... ..X
 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...

 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...

 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...
```

```
 Cell 65
 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...

 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...

 ... ..X ...
 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...
```

# Performance Benchmark

With an average decision time of 1 second, it plays `100-0` against a random player.
